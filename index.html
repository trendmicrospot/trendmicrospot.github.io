            <p>When it comes to keeping your devices safe, Trend Micro remains one of the most reliable antivirus and internet security solutions available today. Whether you are setting it up for the first time or renewing your subscription, knowing how to <strong>Activate Trend Micro with a New Activation Code</strong> or <strong>Activate Trend Micro with Existing Code</strong> can save you time and prevent unnecessary installation issues. The official website <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com.au/activate" target="_blank">trendmicro.com.au activate</a> is your primary portal for starting the activation process.</p>
            
            <p>This guide will take you step-by-step through the process of activating Trend Micro on your PC, Mac, or mobile device, regardless of whether you’re using a fresh code from a new purchase or reactivating with an existing one.</p>

            <h3>Why Proper Activation is Important</h3>
            <p>Correct activation ensures your Trend Micro product is linked to your subscription, enabling all features such as real-time threat scanning, web protection, ransomware defense, and parental controls. Failing to activate properly could leave your system unprotected or cause your subscription to expire prematurely.</p>

            <h3>Requirements Before You Start</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A stable internet connection</li>
                <li>Your Trend Micro activation code (20 characters, alphanumeric)</li>
                <li>An existing Trend Micro account (or the ability to create one)</li>
                <li>The device you wish to protect ready for installation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 1: Locate Your Activation Code</h3>
            <p>Your code can be found:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the retail card or box if purchased in-store</li>
                <li>In the confirmation email from your online purchase</li>
                <li>Inside your Trend Micro account if it’s an existing subscription</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are reactivating, this is the <strong>Activate Trend Micro with Existing Code</strong> process, so you’ll use your current code.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Go to the Official Activation Page</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>Your account will be the central hub for managing your subscription.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Enter Your Activation Code</h3>
            <p>On the activation page, type in your 20-character code exactly as shown. Avoid adding spaces, and make sure you distinguish between similar characters like “O” and zero.</p>

            <p>For <strong>Activate Trend Micro with Existing Code</strong>, use your current subscription code.</p>
            <p>Click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Confirm Your Subscription Details</h3>

                <li>The expiration date</li>
                <li>The number of devices covered</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Start the Download</h3>
            <p>Click the <strong>Download</strong> button for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Android, or iOS). This will initiate the Trend Micro installer download.</p>

            <h3>Step 7: Install Trend Micro on Your Device</h3>

                <li>Wait for the installation to complete</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 8: Sign In During Installation</h3>
            <p>During setup, you’ll be prompted to sign into your Trend Micro account. This ensures the software is linked to your activated subscription.</p>

            <h3>Step 9: Complete Activation</h3>

            <h3>Step 10: Run the First Security Scan</h3>

            <h3>Troubleshooting Activation Issues</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Already Used Code:</strong> It may be tied to another account; log in with that account instead</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If issues persist, visit the Trend Micro Support section on their website.</p>
